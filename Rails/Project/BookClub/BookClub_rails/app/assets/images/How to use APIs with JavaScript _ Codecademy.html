            <p>You saw a request in the first exercise. Now it's time for you to make your own! (Don't worry, we'll help.)</p>

<p>On <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="line-no" data-from="1" data-to="">line 1</a>, we've created the <code class="undefined">xhr</code> variable, which stands for <strong>XML HTTP Request</strong>. This is how we make an HTTP request!</p>

<p>On <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="line-no" data-from="2" data-to="">line 2</a>, we make the actual request to Codecademy.com.</p>

<p>We haven't sent our request, though, and we need to <code class="perl">console.<span class="keyword">log</span></code> both the <code class="undefined">xhr.status</code> (that was that "200" from before) and the <code class="undefined">xhr.statusText</code> (it should be "OK").</p>

<p>For that, we'll need your help!</p>

<p>On <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="line-no" data-from="5" data-to="">lines 5</a> – 6, <code class="perl">console.<span class="keyword">log</span></code> the <code class="undefined">xhr.status</code> and <code class="undefined">xhr.statusText</code> attributes so we can see if Codecademy got our request okay.</p>
